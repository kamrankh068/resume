I sat almost 23 to 25 companies for the placement but unfortunately, I could not get the placement to those companies but at the last of placement session in my college LNCT Group of College, Bhopal.

The first question is to print star pattern, The print sum of prime number between 90 to 100, Print table of prime no between 90 to 100,<br> 
                To reverse the string and print the last element of an array. After the technical round, they call me for HR and ask about the relocation, Family background, bound and the salary, etc.

First-round is written test, In a written test they ask some question C, java, SQL, basic Unix commands and one programming question. I qualify the written test and go to the next technical round, In a technical round they ask me lots of question, First they ask me to explain your project, Basic Linux command, gives me 3 code to solve them, puzzle and SQL question. In a technical round, I explain my project in detail and they ask me a cross-question. The technical round for almost one hour. After that, they call me for HR round, In HR round ask me simple HR questions like that why should you join Amdocs? family background etc.
